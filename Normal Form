We Did 3NF 


Users Table:
This table contains potential transitive dependencies. Columns like user_country, Address, 
and Relationship could be further normalized to achieve 3rd Normal Form (3NF). Breaking down these 
attributes into separate tables and linking them through foreign keys referencing the user_id could eliminate 
these transitive dependencies.

Posts Table:
This table seems to be in 3rd Normal Form (3NF) as it stands. There don't seem to be any apparent transitive dependencies.

Comments Table:
This table also appears to be in 3rd Normal Form (3NF) as it stands. There don't seem to be any apparent transitive dependencies.

User_Messages Table:
Similarly, this table seems to be in 3rd Normal Form (3NF) as it stands. There don't seem to be any apparent transitive dependencies.

Post_Likes Table:
This table also seems to be in 3rd Normal Form (3NF) as it stands. There don't seem to be any apparent transitive dependencies.


Upon reevaluation, it seems that with the given information, the Posts, Comments, User_Messages, and Post_Likes tables 
appear to be in 3rd Normal Form. However, the Users table could benefit from further normalization to eliminate transitive 
dependencies and fully adhere to 3NF principles. Specifically, considering separating out related data (like user_country, 
Address, and Relationship) into separate tables linked by the user_id.
